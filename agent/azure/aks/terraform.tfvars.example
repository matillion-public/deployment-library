# Authentication Configuration
# ========================================
# Choose ONE of the following authentication methods:

# Option 1: Azure Workload Identity (Recommended - No credentials needed!)
# Uncomment these lines to use Workload Identity:
workload_identity_enabled = true
service_principal_enabled = false
# service_principal_client_id = ""  # Not needed for Workload Identity
# service_principal_secret = ""     # Not needed for Workload Identity

# Option 2: Service Principal (Legacy - Requires managing credentials)
# Uncomment these lines to use Service Principal instead:
# workload_identity_enabled = false
# service_principal_enabled = true
# service_principal_client_id = "your-service-principal-client-id"
# service_principal_secret = "your-service-principal-secret"
